CakePHP Blog Tutorial to mess up.

Currently the only meaningful point is to show how to add many-to-many relationship records using HABTM.

The source code is under /src/blog folder.  Use it (or /src/blog/app/webroot) as your website root.

The database schema is under /database/backup folder.

Some features to show:
- how to add many-to-many relationship records using HABTM
- ReportManager
- how to use vagrant to setup an development environment
- how to use cookie: set in one page, and read from another
- how to use CakeHelper?  My CakeHelper demo is not successful.

- [CakePHP UrlCache plugin](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-url-cache) from CakePHP core team member, seems to be a better option than CacheHelper.
